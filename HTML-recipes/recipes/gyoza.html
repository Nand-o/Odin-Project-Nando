        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <p>This 1x recipe (10 servings)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped cabbage</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped carrot</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) package wonton wrappers</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add
                cabbage, onion, carrot, and garlic; cook and stir until cabbage
                is limp, 3 to 4 minutes. Add ground pork and egg; cook and stir
                until pork is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Make the gyoza: Place about 1 tablespoon pork mixture into the
                center of a wonton wrapper. Fold wrapper in half over filling,
                then seal the edges with moistened fingers. Repeat to make
                remaining gyoza.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
                Cook gyoza in the hot skillet until lightly browned, about 1
                minute per side. Add water to the skillet, reduce the heat,
                cover, and steam gyoza until water is gone. Remove from the
                heat.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Mix soy sauce and rice vinegar together in a small bowl. Serve
                as a dipping sauce with gyoza.</li>
        </ol>
